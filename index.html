                                         <p>
                                                This was my first car show. I was over the moon and filled with emotions. Let’s take a moment to describe all that I felt. Imagine being in room of people who share the same interests and are extremely passionate about what they like.
                                                Imagine getting to experience something that you’ve only seen on TV.
                                                That’s how I felt, I was in total awe of everything. 
                                                Jaw on the floor. Super surreal and I’m happy that I bow have that memory embedded forever.
                                        </p> 
                                               
                                         <p>The cars were spectacular. The kept with so much care. Car that were built long before I was born were still in pristine condition. 
                                                Almost like they would have just came off the market. 
                                                Additionally, I made a car friend that gave me to go on many more car adventures like car races. 
                                                If you’re interested in cars, i believe that going to car shows will help to deepen your interest.

                                                <p> When I came to UWI, I wanted to be apart of a club that gives back nothing matter how small. 
                                                        Rotaract was that club and still is that club. Just like at the car show, we at Rotaract click. It made so much sense. 
                                                        I enjoy going to club every Thursday. It’s the perfect way to destress and remind myself of why I do the things I do. 
                                                        It’s always a good time with great people and good vibes. I’m happy that I’ve found my 
                                                        people and I’m able to pour into others and their communities.

                                                <p>Thus being apart of something that is bigger than me, something that will create an impact on generations to come. 
                                                        I am truly grateful for every opportunity that I get to give back to what's truly important to me.
